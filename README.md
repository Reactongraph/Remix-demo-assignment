# Material UI - Remix example in TypeScript

## How to use

Clone the repo

Install it and run:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
## The idea behind the example

The project uses [Remix](https://remix.run/), which is a full-stack web framework.
It includes `@mui/material` and its peer dependencies, including [Emotion](https://emotion.sh/docs/introduction), the default style engine in Material UI v6.
If you prefer, you can [use styled-components instead](https://mui.com/material-ui/integrations/interoperability/#styled-components).

## What's next?
